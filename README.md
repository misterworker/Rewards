# Microsoft Rewards Card Click Automation

This repository automates the process of clicking Microsoft Rewards cards using the Edge browser and Selenium

## üéØ What It Does

- Launches Microsoft Edge with your user profile
- Navigates to [https://rewards.bing.com/](https://rewards.bing.com/)
- Identifies clickable reward cards
- Clicks through eligible cards, opens them in a new tab if needed, waits briefly, and then returns

## üß† Logic & Rules

1. **Always Click First 3 Cards**
   - Cards at indices 0, 1, and 2 (the first three) are always clicked, regardless of the day. 
   
   -> This is the daily set

2. **Skip Inactive Cards**
   - Cards 4, 5, and 6 (indices 3, 4, 5) are skipped entirely ‚Äî they're known to be inactive.
   
   -> Not sure why this exists

3. **Day-Based Logic for Remaining Cards**
   - Cards beyond the first 3 are only clicked on:
     - **Wednesday**
     - **Friday**
     - **Sunday**

   -> No need to click extra cards every day.

4. **Tab Handling**
   - If a card opens in a new tab, the script switches to it, waits a few seconds, then closes the tab and returns.
   - If no new tab opens, it uses the browser‚Äôs back button.

5. **Natural Behavior**
   - Wait times are randomized to simulate human interaction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3
- Microsoft Edge installed
- Microsoft Edge WebDriver downloaded
- Selenium installed (`pip install selenium`)

## üìÅ Paths to Update

Update the following variables in the script with the correct paths on your system:

```python
EDGE_DRIVER_PATH = r"C:\path\to\msedgedriver.exe"
EDGE_AUTOMATION_PROFILE_PATH = r"C:\path\to\EdgeProfile"
```

## Deploy
Use Google Cloud Compute Engine, e2 micro 30GB with standard disk for free usage. This is a headless VM, so you'll have to uncomment the headless option if needed. Install all dependencies, run automate_login with your email and one time passcode, then set up a cron job for rewards.py to be executed daily.

## Telegram Bot Webhook for status confirmation
1. Create a bot on BotFather in Telegram
2. Obtain the API key for your bot and proceed with the following
```bash
curl -o ngrok.zip https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.zip
unzip ngrok.zip
sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin/

ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>

nohup ngrok http 8000 > ngrok.log 2>&1 & # Get the link from the log file

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "<forwardinglink>/webhook"}' "https://api.telegram.org/bot<telegram_bot_token>/setWebhook"
```

## Ubuntu Setup and Rewards Bot Installation Guide

```bash
# Update and upgrade system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install essential tools
sudo apt install -y wget curl unzip git software-properties-common

# Install Python3, pip, and venv
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv

# Add Microsoft Edge repository and key
curl -fsSL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg > /dev/null
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge stable main"
sudo apt update

# Install Microsoft Edge
sudo apt install -y microsoft-edge-stable

# Get installed Edge version
EDGE_VERSION=$(microsoft-edge-stable --version | grep -oP '[0-9.]+')

# Download matching Edge WebDriver
wget "https://msedgedriver.azureedge.net/${EDGE_VERSION}/edgedriver_linux64.zip" -O msedgedriver.zip

# Unzip and move WebDriver
unzip msedgedriver.zip
chmod +x msedgedriver
sudo mv msedgedriver /usr/local/bin/

# Clone your Rewards repository
git clone https://github.com/misterworker/Rewards.git
cd Rewards

# Create and activate Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run `automate_login.py`
The following launches [login.live.com](login.live.com) and autocompletes the login setup for you using an otp sent to your email. Just fill out the user input from the program once and you should be permanently logged into your account.

```bash
cd Rewards
source venv/bin/activate
python automate_login.py
```

## Setup cron jobs
Your job should now run at UTC+0 at 1am (9am in Singapore). It typically takes 2 to 3 minutes for the process to complete. (Longer if you have a shit VM)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cron

sudo service cron start

crontab -e
0 1 * * * /home/<your_username_here>/Rewards/venv/bin/python /home/<your_username_here>/Rewards/rewards.py # Paste at bottom of file
```
